WELCOME TO TANK WARS
--------------------------
-> SINGLEPLAYER
	In singleplayer you control a tank with the WASD keys and 
	shoot using the mouse. Enemies are constantly spawning 
	so be on guard. The longer you stay alive the harder
	it becomes and the enemy will start sending in the 
	Tiger tank. WATCH OUT!
-> MULTIPLAYER
	Two players fight to the death. Player ONE plays with the
	 WASD keys and rotates the turret with Q and E keys, and 
	shoots with SPACE. Player TWO moves with the mouse and
	automatically aims at the second player, press a mouse 
	button to shoot. Player TWO is slower than player ONE.
-> BOULDERS AND LAKES
	Boulders are good for cover, but they are also a tough 
	obstacle to navigate. Unlike boulders you can shoot over 
	lakes.
-> PICK UPS
	Pick ups will spawn periodically for the player. Enemy 
	battle maps will increase your score in Singleplayer. 
	The wrench will repair you and the Shield will protect 
	you from one hit (useful against a Tiger).
